# Artist Statement  
## Logic is found in the chaos around us.

In the initial creation of a composition plan, the process begins from within, each layer exerting its influence on the next. Yet, even with meticulous plans, the movement of acrylic particles takes on a life of their own – shifting, sliding, and meandering unpredictably. It is in these moments of serendipity that chance lends its hand, giving rise to fractures and unforeseen textures. Gravity assumes its role as arbiter, guiding individual pigments into graceful swirls and bleeds. It is within this dance of controlled chaos that true beauty comes to light – not birthed from sterile perfection, but rather shaped through deliberate choices, a pursuit to subdue disorder and mold it according to my vision.

Amidst this creative process, truth emerges; an eloquent metaphor for the world that surrounds us. While on the surface, chaos may reign; deeper inspection reveals the subtle threads of logic woven into the fabric of disorder. The very essence of life's complexity finds its reflection in the interplay of pigments and pours, reminding us that even amidst turmoil, order and meaning persist, waiting to be deciphered.
