# MicroZoo  
**Completed December 2014**  

*MicroZoo* celebrates the alien world hiding at our fingertips. While headlines chase galaxies and rovers, these works scale up the nearly invisible—tiny organisms, textures, and architectures—until the minuscule becomes monumental. Less Hubble, more humble.

We live in an age where science feels like modern magic: new galaxies discovered, robots roaming Mars, even a comet’s “song” recorded. *MicroZoo* turns the lens the other way. Instead of the faraway, it spotlights the strange and spectacular life we pass by every day—too small to notice without help.  

Inspired by microscopy, pattern study, and the unruly intelligence of nature, I build a micro-menagerie and enlarge it to human scale. The forms hover between specimen and story—grounded in biology, colored by imagination. By making the tiny impossible to ignore, the work asks us to recalibrate our gaze: to trade spectacle for attention, and wonder for wonder’s sake.  

Step closer. The vast is hiding in the small. The universe is local.
