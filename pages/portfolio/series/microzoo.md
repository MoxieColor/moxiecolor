# MicroZoo  
Completed December 2014

“MicroZoo” encapsulates a contemplation of our world's boundless marvels, where science has assumed the role of modern-day enchantment. Frequently, headlines are seized by monumental revelations—new galaxies unveiled, Mars traversed by rovers, and the harmonious melodies of comets heard. Yet, nestled within this grand tapestry are minuscule wonders, so infinitesimal that even if they rested before us, they would remain concealed without the aid of magnification. What if this realm of alien wonders, capable of perplexing our imaginations, existed not in distant stars, but right at our fingertips?

Drawing inspiration from this notion, I've meticulously assembled a micro menagerie of terrestrial creatures. I've brought these diminutive marvels to life on a scale that defies reality. In a world often preoccupied with the vast and expansive, “MicroZoo” beckons us to recalibrate our gaze and perceive the mesmerizing spectacle of the small and overlooked. I invite you to step into a world of hidden wonders, where the minuscule becomes monumental and the intricate details of life at the microscale are unveiled before your eyes.
