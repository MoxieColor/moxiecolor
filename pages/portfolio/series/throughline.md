# Throughline  
**Completed August 2023**  

*Throughline* builds big stories from small pieces. Individual paintings keep their own voice; together they make a chorus. Seams stay visible on purpose—the connective tissue is the point. We’re many, and we’re one.  

(Images coming soon!)

*Throughline* is modular on the surface and communal at heart. I paint in small units, then assemble them into larger fields—shifting pieces until edges start a conversation. Layers overlap, colors echo across panels, and little frictions keep the harmony honest. No single square gets the solo for long.  

The title points to what carries through: a color that repeats, a gesture that returns, a seam that guides the eye. Like a quilt, a skyline, or a crowd, the whole reads differently than any one part. Differences don’t get sanded down; they’re what make the structure hold.  

The work is a simple metaphor for how we live—distinct, interdependent, stitched together by shared moments. As you move through these composites, notice where your eye lingers and what paths you trace. That’s your throughline meeting mine: a reminder that connection isn’t a slogan, it’s a practice of attention.
