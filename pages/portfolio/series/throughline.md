# Throughline  
Completed August 2023

"Throughline," explores the intricate tapestry of human existence by assembling small paintings into larger, unified compositions. Just as threads intertwine to create a complex fabric, our individual lives are woven into a grand narrative of experiences, emotions, and aspirations. Through this series, I aim to convey that while we are unique entities, we are fundamentally connected by the common thread of humanity.

The act of combining these small paintings is a metaphor for the collective human experience. Just as society thrives on collaboration and coexistence, so do these artworks. Layers of paint blend and overlap, signifying the shared moments, struggles, and triumphs that shape our collective narrative. The colors harmonize, reflecting the harmony that arises when we acknowledge both our similarities and differences.

As viewers engage with "Throughline," I hope they are drawn to explore their own place in this intricate network of existence. By celebrating diversity and unity simultaneously, I aim to foster a deeper sense of empathy and understanding. Just as the eye navigates the intricate details of these composite paintings, may we navigate the intricacies of our shared human story with compassion and an appreciation for the beauty that arises when we recognize ourselves in others.

"Throughline" invites us to reconsider our role in the broader canvas of life, urging us to embrace our uniqueness while recognizing the common thread that binds us all. It is my aspiration that this series serves as a visual reminder that we are, indeed, one and the same, intricately connected through the delicate strokes of our shared human experience.
