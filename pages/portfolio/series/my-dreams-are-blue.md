# My Dreams Are Blue  
**Completed April 2014**  

Dreams are slippery; the harder I reach, the faster they dissolve. *My Dreams Are Blue* tries to hold that feeling—deep blue pours guided by gravity, where forms warp, crack, and drift like memory underwater.  

(images coming soon!)  

I rarely remember my dreams—just shapes, moods, a recurring theme. It feels like reaching through water: fragments shimmer, then slip. This series leans into that almost-remembered state.  

I work in deep acrylic pours, letting gravity do part of the drawing. I pour into and over earlier layers so the new paint bends around existing topography. A threadlike underlayer sets a path; thicker skins fracture into wider crevices, thinner washes craze into fine lines—controlled chance, on purpose.  

The blue is not just color, it’s temperature and buoyancy. It holds those brief, weightless moments when gravity seems to lift—pain eases, breath deepens, time slows. Each layer cures for 24–48 hours; the whole series took about six months. The titles point to the themes that surface and resurface as I refine.  

Less dream interpretation, more dream sensation: a record of how memory blurs, cracks, and somehow still rings true.
