# Redaction In A Minor  
**Completed April 2018**  

Start with a 1940s how-to manual. Erase every “A”—except one stubborn capital left as a witness. Text becomes constellations; meaning turns to pattern. *Redaction In A Minor* uses absence as ink: less headline noise, more quiet signal. No right-side-up; one redacted page becomes a repeating tile.   

(Images coming soon!)

Lately the feed feels like a shouting match: takes on takes, bots posing as people, “breaking” that rarely breaks new ground. I needed subtraction. So I pulled a timeworn reference book—a 1940s tool manual with that library-stack perfume—and began removing every single “A.” Not black bars, but deliberate marks following aesthetic logic.  

The pages shifted from language to star maps: dotted fields, small galaxies of redaction. It was oddly calming—less debate, more doing—and it kept going. The patterns started reading like textiles, which clicked. I began making paintings that harmonize without a fixed orientation; turn them any direction and they hold. One sheet composed only of redacted “A” marks became the seed tile for a repeat.  

Why “A Minor”? Because the letter is (almost) gone, the mood sits in a lower key—and one capital “A” is intentionally left unredacted. That lone major note inside a minor field keeps the key signature honest.  

The work asks what remains when you strip the loudest characters away: which structures persist, what new readings appear, and who decides what gets erased. In a culture hooked on hot takes and “fake news,” this series is my cool take: fewer exclamation points, more looking. And yes—many A’s were harmed in the making.
