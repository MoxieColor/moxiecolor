# Meditations  
Completed March 2015

"Meditations" is a series borne of the symbiosis between the textile surface design technique of shibori and the evocative allure of Rorschach ink blots. Within each stratum of paint lies a narrative akin to the gradual immersion into a yoga poseâ€”each layer melding organically into the next, assuming its intended contours. The paper, saturated with a blend of acrylic paint and water, is then suspended for drying, inviting an additional dance of fluidity along the grain of the paper fibers. A choreography of layers unfolds, where the influence of prior applications reverberates through subsequent ones, orchestrating a gentle resistance that curbs any inclination of the paint to venture beyond its designated boundaries.
