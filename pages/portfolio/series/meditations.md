# Meditations  
**Completed March 2015**  

*Meditations* blends shibori logic with Rorschach symmetry. Thin acrylic layers soak and settle as the paper hangs to dry, guided by gravity and the paper’s grain. Each pass meets the last—like easing into a yoga pose. The result: quiet, mirrored fields where control and chance share the brush.

*Meditations* is slow looking made visible. Inspired by shibori’s resist patterns and the mirror-play of Rorschach blots, I build images in patient layers of thinned acrylic. The paper is saturated, then hung. Gravity pulls, fibers steer, and the pigment finds its own edges.

Each layer listens to the one before it. Prior applications create a soft, almost resist-like boundary that encourages the next wash to pause rather than spill—less rule, more gentle suggestion. The forms arrive gradually, like easing into a pose and letting breath do the work.

What remains is a conversation between structure and surrender: symmetry without stiffness, movement without hurry. These pieces are less “ta-da” and more exhale—an invitation to stand still for a moment and notice how small shifts accumulate into shape.
