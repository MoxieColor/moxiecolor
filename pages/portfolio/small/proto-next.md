# ProtoNext  
Completed September 2015  

**Sold Out**  

“ProtoNext” emerged as a spirited dialogue among artists, a discussion kindled by the accessibility of art. Fueled by the belief that art should be within everyone's reach, I embarked on a mission to redefine the relationship between creativity and affordability.

Originating from the seeds of contemplation sown during the Meditations series, “ProtoNext” became an embodiment of these reflections. What began as a trail of prototypes eventually crystallized into an epiphany—the prototypes themselves held the essence of my artistic vision. With a heart open to the world, I invited all to witness my creative journey. In this spirit, ProtoNext was born.

Comprising a collection of 160 petite 5” x 5” acrylic paintings, ProtoNext channels a core tenet: each new piece weaves its narrative in conversation with its predecessors. Here, compositions evolve, an artistic symphony where successful motifs dance and others gracefully concede to the melody of change. Much like the timeless whispers of a game of telephone, the foundational notes echo as harmonies shift and transform.

Yet, at the heart of ProtoNext lies a powerful testament—the celebration of affordability. This series champions the idea that art's embrace should be expansive, catering to every budget. It reaffirms that within the vibrant realm of creativity, everyone can own a piece of the narrative. ProtoNext is an invitation to share in the magic of artistic evolution, underscoring the belief that inspiration need not be confined by price, but liberated for all to experience.
