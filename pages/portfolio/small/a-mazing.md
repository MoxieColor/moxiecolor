# A-Mazing  
Completed February 2017

Crafted with the distinct purpose of contributing to the A-Mazing Art Show at Mad Hat Tea Co., this series of collages was conceived in literal alignment with the event's themeâ€”mazes and puzzles. The intention was to not only evoke the intricacies of labyrinthine paths but also to delve into the layered puzzle of societal expectations and their impact on single women, a subject that has engaged my thoughts during first person observations.

The term 'maze' encapsulates more than mere physical complexity; it symbolizes the intricate corridors of experiences and judgments that individuals traverse. Reflecting upon the social commentary intertwined with the anticipations placed upon single women, I felt an unyielding pull to translate these perceptions into visual narratives. The collages serve as both mirrors and windows, capturing glimpses of the multi-dimensional lives that emerge when societal expectations intersect with personal identity.

Each piece within this collection echoes the delicate balance between conformity and autonomy, inviting viewers to explore the labyrinthine emotions and reflections embedded within. By amalgamating the themes of mazes and societal expectations, these collages transform into a canvas for contemplation and discourse, offering a glimpse into the enigmatic journey of single women navigating an intricate cultural landscape.
