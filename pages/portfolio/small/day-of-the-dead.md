# Day of the Dead  
**Ongoing**  

Day of the Dead, in paper, paint, and imagination. Skeletons ride turtles, serenade the night, and clatter past on horse bones. Bright washes, cut shapes, hand-drawn edges—joy forward, grief welcomed. These are tiny fiestas for the ones we love.

This ongoing series is where I let color and cut paper run. I paint sheets in marigold, obsidian, and jade, then slice and layer them with acrylic details until the figures feel mid-stride—music up, candles lit.  

It’s simple on purpose: paper, paint, and imagination. The point isn’t to mourn in grayscale—it’s to celebrate in full volume, to laugh with our ghosts and keep them in the room. If a piece makes you smile and get a lump in your throat at the same time, that’s the dance.
