# Day of the Dead  
Ongoing  

Creating collages with Day of the Dead themes is an endeavor fueled by pure enjoyment, free from judgment. The vibrant and lively spirit of this celebration resonates deeply with my artistic sensibilities, inspiring me to explore its themes in a playful and imaginative way. Through each collage, I embrace the colorful and symbolic elements that make Day of the Dead so captivating, without any reservations. This creative journey is a celebration of art and culture, a chance to revel in the joy of crafting something that speaks to my heart and I hope brings a smile to your face.
