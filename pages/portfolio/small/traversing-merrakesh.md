# Traversing Marrakesh  
Lost on purpose. Found by map and compass.
Completed October 2013  

In June 2013 I landed in Marrakesh with no phone data. Directions vanished into a blur of donkey carts and mopeds, so I learned to read the streets by light, sound, and a paper map I guarded like gold. These works trace that lost-and-found feeling—layering the actual map into the pieces.

Traversing Marrakesh grew from a very analog adventure in June 2013. With no phone data, my neat turn-by-turn plan dissolved into the everyday choreography of Marrakesh—donkey carts, mopeds, calls to prayer, sudden shade. I carried a paper map like a life preserver and learned to navigate by landmarks and the compass app on my phone. A small, memorable win was finding my way out of the souks on my own.
Back home, I brought that experience into the studio. The original map appears throughout the work—cut, layered, and re-oriented—marking the moments between disorientation and clarity. This series is a thank-you to a city that made me look up, slow down, and find direction the long way.
