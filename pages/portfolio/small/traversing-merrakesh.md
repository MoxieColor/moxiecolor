# Traversing Marrakesh  
Lost on purpose. Found by map and compass.  
**Completed October 2013**  

In June 2013 I landed in Marrakesh with no phone data. Directions vanished into a blur of donkey carts and mopeds, so I learned to read the streets by light, sound, and a paper map I guarded like gold. These works trace that lost-and-found feeling—layering the actual map into the pieces.

*Traversing Marrakesh* grew from a very analog adventure. With no data, my neat turn-by-turn plan dissolved into the city’s everyday choreography—donkey carts, mopeds, calls to prayer, sudden shade. I carried a paper map like a life preserver and leaned on the compass app when Wi-Fi found me. A small, favorite win: finding my way out of the souks on my own.
Back home I cut and layered the original map into the work—re-orienting it to mark the flip from disorientation to clarity. This series is a thank-you to a city that made me look up, slow down, and find direction the long way.
