# She’s Had Enough
Five women, five boxes they never asked for: measured, graded, shamed, sexualized, taxed—and expected to keep the candles blazing at both ends. It’s exhausting. This series draws the line: they’re done performing. She’s had enough. Change starts now.

## Statement:  
We’re living in a split-screen moment: real progress on one side, backsliding on the other. The Equal Rights Amendment is still stalled in legal limbo. The “pink tax” keeps resurfacing under new packaging. Period products are still taxed in parts of the U.S. And the wage gap—however you slice it—remains stubborn. Different year, same markup.  

Meanwhile, women are put on pedestals and under microscopes—saint and object, caretaker and workhorse—told to “have it all” while doing it all. Gold star or scarlet letter, there’s always a test. The figures in this series carry that strain: bodies measured and mislabeled, candles burning from both ends, light turning to smoke.  

She’s Had Enough is part protest, part boundary. It refuses the old game of “shrink it and pink it,” of unpaid labor dressed up as gratitude, of value defined by someone else’s checklist. These works say: no more. No more quiet compliance. No more double standards with fine print.  

If you recognize yourself here, you’re not alone. This is a call and a catalyst—one more match struck. She’s had enough. It’s time for a change now.
