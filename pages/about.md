# About the Artist

I’m a Pacific Northwest artist with a background in data visualization and storytelling. My creative process blends structure with spontaneity — seeking beauty in order and magic in mess.

My work has been featured in installations, private collections, and digital collaborations. When I’m not creating, I’m exploring ways to connect art with everyday life.
