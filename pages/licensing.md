## Digital downloads (Gumroad) — commercial use at launch
To keep things simple at launch, **digital downloads are non-commercial**.  
That means: **no selling** products that incorporate the digital files, even if modified. Please use them for Personal/Classroom/School as above. If you’re a business and want to discuss a commercial use, reach out for a tailored license.

> Why? I’m starting with clear, maker-friendly terms and will revisit digital commercial options later.

## Spoonflower — small-maker friendly, brand-controlled

### Small makers (allowed without a separate license)
You may **make and sell physical items** using my Spoonflower fabric/wallpaper **as a small maker**, provided all of the following are true:
- You’re a **sole proprietor or team ≤ 3 people**.
- You produce **≤ 100 units per design per year** (any hand-made physical good).
- You sell **direct-to-consumer** (your website, Etsy, in-person).
- No wholesale to retailers; no retail chains; no licensed packaging.

**You may:**
- Photograph/market your finished physical goods.
- State the material source (e.g., “surface design by Jennifer Chin, fabric by Spoonflower”).

**You may not:**
- Scan/recreate/trace the pattern digitally.
- Sell, share, or upload the **digital design**.
- Use the design in logos/trademarks.
- Upload the design to third-party POD/stock sites as an asset.

### Brands / wholesale / large runs (Brand License required)
If **any** of the following apply, please request a **Brand License**:
- Team size **> 3** or company-run production.
- **> 100 units per design per year**, or any wholesale.
- Retail distribution (boutiques or chains), packaging, or co-branded collabs.

## Amazon/KDP (paperbacks)
- You’re buying a **book** (physical). Classroom/School allowances depend on the edition noted on the product page.
- Please don’t scan or redistribute the interior pages as digital files.

---

## Common scenarios (and answers)
- **I’m a solo Etsy seller making zipper pouches from your fabric. Okay?**  
  Yes—this fits the **Spoonflower small-maker** allowance (stay under the unit cap).

- **My boutique wants 500 pillows from your fabric.**  
  That’s a **Brand License** request (wholesale + unit count).

- **Can two teachers share one digital download?**  
  Please purchase one license per teacher, or choose **School/Org** for a team.

- **Can I post worksheets to a public blog?**  
  Please don’t post the files. You can share photos/previews and link to the product page.

- **Can I use your pattern in my logo or app UI?**  
  Not without a written license add-on—please contact me.

## Refunds & replacements
If a file is corrupted or you chose the wrong license, reply to your receipt or [contact me]({{ '/about/' | relative_url }}). I’m human and reasonable.

## The legal-ish bit
This page is a plain-English summary. The **full license text** inside each download (and your receipt) is the binding version. Copyright remains with **Jennifer Chin / Moxie Color**. Licenses are non-exclusive and non-transferable. **No use of any asset to train ML/AI models or datasets.**
