## Top questions

### I bought a **digital download**. Where’s my file?
After checkout, Gumroad shows a download button **and** emails you a receipt with a download link.
- Can’t find it? Check spam/promotions and make sure you used the right email.
- Still stuck? Log into your **Gumroad Library** (the email you used at checkout) or contact me via **About** with your order email.

### Can I use your **digital files commercially**?
Not at launch. Digital downloads are **non-commercial** (see [Licensing]({{ '/licensing/' | relative_url }})). Personal, Classroom (1 teacher), and School/Org uses are fine.

### I’m a **small maker** using your **Spoonflower** fabric/wallpaper. Can I sell what I sew/make?
Yes—if you’re a solo or ≤3-person team, producing **≤100 units per design per year**, and selling direct-to-consumer. No scanning/redistributing the digital pattern, and no wholesale. (Full details in [Licensing]({{ '/licensing/' | relative_url }}).)

### What if I’m a **brand/retailer** or need **wholesale**?
You’ll need a **Brand License**. Tell me your product, unit estimate, and channels via **About** and I’ll quote quickly.

## Digital downloads (Gumroad)

### What file format do I get?
PDFs for printables; occasional PNG/JPG/ZIP for assets (as listed on each product page).

### Can I print at school or at a copy shop?
Yes—**Personal/Classroom/School** licenses allow printing within your license. Please don’t share the source files beyond your license scope.

### Mobile won’t download—help?
Some mobile browsers block direct downloads. Try long-press “Download” → “Download Linked File,” or use a laptop/desktop and move it to your device via Files/Drive.

### Do files expire?
Your links don’t intentionally expire, but platforms sometimes rotate links. Keep your receipt email and back up your files.

## Spoonflower orders (fabric, wallpaper, decor)

### Who fulfills and ships?
**Spoonflower** prints and ships made-to-order. Questions about shipping, swatches, and returns go through Spoonflower support.

### Can I change the **scale** or request a **color tweak**?
Often yes—message me via **About** with the design name and what you need (e.g., “50% smaller,” “more teal”). If feasible, I’ll add an alternate listing on Spoonflower.

### Can I sell items I make?
Small makers: yes (see limits above). Brands/wholesale: request a **Brand License**.

---

## Amazon/KDP (paperbacks)

### When will the book be available?
It’s in review. Join the [Newsletter]({{ '/newsletter/' | relative_url }}) and I’ll email you when it goes live.

### Classroom copies?
When KDP editions are live, the product page will note whether it’s a **Personal** or **Classroom/School** edition.

## Licensing & permissions

### Quick recap?
- **Digital downloads:** non-commercial at launch.
- **Classroom (1 teacher):** okay to share with your own students (closed access).
- **School/Org:** internal sharing at one site.
- **Spoonflower small makers:** ≤3 people, ≤100 units/design/year, DTC only.
- **Brands/wholesale:** ask for a **Brand License**.

Full details: [Licensing]({{ '/licensing/' | relative_url }}).

### Can I use your art in a **logo** or **app UI**?
Not without a written license add-on. Ask and we’ll scope it.

### AI/training datasets?
No use of any assets to train ML/AI models or datasets.

## Orders, refunds, and receipts

### Refunds on digital items?
If a file is corrupted or you bought the wrong license by accident, reply to your receipt or contact me via **About**—I’m human and reasonable.

### Refunds on Spoonflower or KDP?
Handled by those platforms under their policies.

### Receipt/invoice?
Your platform receipt is your invoice (Gumroad/Spoonflower/Amazon). If you need a custom note (e.g., school name), forward your receipt and I’ll append one.

## Discounts & newsletter

### Do you have discount codes?
Occasionally. The best way to get them is the [Newsletter]({{ '/newsletter/' | relative_url }}).

### Free sample?
A printable sample is coming to Gumroad soon—watch the newsletter for the drop.

## Accessibility & printing tips

### Are your files screen-reader friendly?
I provide descriptive alt text and clear headings where applicable. If you need a different format, tell me what works best and I’ll try to accommodate.

### Colors look different when I print—normal?
Screens are backlit; paper isn’t. For best results: print at 100% scale, “Actual Size,” and choose “High quality” or “Best.” Home printers vary—test a page before a class set.
